Assignments for this week:
1. Basic Arithmetic Calculator
ðŸ“Œ Concepts: Arithmetic operators, input handling
ðŸ”¹ Task: Write a Java program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /, %) as input
    and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.

Input:
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operator (+, -, *, /, %): *

(Inputs 10, 5 & * are being entered by user. Program should take input from user for first,
second number and operator)

Output:
Result (10 * 5) = 50


2. Temperature Converter
ðŸ“Œ Concepts: Data types, arithmetic operations
ðŸ”¹ Task: Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
ðŸ”¹ Formula:
â€¢	Fahrenheit = (Celsius Ã— 9/5) + 32
â€¢	Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) Ã— 5/9

Input:
Enter temperature: 100
Choose conversion (C -> F or F -> C): C

(Inputs 100 & C are being entered by user)

Output:
Fahrenheit: 212Â°F

3. Check Leap Year
ðŸ“Œ Concepts: Logical & relational operators
ðŸ”¹ Task: Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.
ðŸ”¹ Leap Year Conditions:
â€¢	Divisible by 4
â€¢	Not divisible by 100, unless also divisible by 400

Input:
Enter year: 2024
(Input 2024 is being entered by user)

Output:
2024 is a leap year.

4. Student Grade Calculator
ðŸ“Œ Concepts: Arithmetic & relational operators, conditional statements
ðŸ”¹ Task: Accept marks for 5 subjects, calculate percentage, and assign a grade:
â€¢	>= 90 â†’ A
â€¢	80-89 â†’ B
â€¢	70-79 â†’ C
â€¢	< 70 â†’ Fail

Input:
Enter marks in 5 subjects: 85 90 78 88 92
(Input 85, 90, 78, 88, 92 separated by spaces is entered by user)
Output:
Grade : B
