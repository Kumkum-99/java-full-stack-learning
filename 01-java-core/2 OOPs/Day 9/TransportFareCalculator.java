Transport Fare Calculator
üîπ Objective:
Demonstrate method overriding by implementing different fare calculation logic for various transport types.
________________________________________
üìù Problem Statement:
Create a base class Transport and derive classes Bus, Train, and Taxi.
Each subclass should override the calculateFare(int distance) method with its own pricing logic.
________________________________________
üîß Requirements:
1.	Base Class: Transport
o	Method: public double calculateFare(int distance)
o	Default logic: fare = distance * 1.0
2.	Derived Classes:
o	Bus: fare = distance * 0.5
o	Train: fare = distance * 0.8
o	Taxi: fare = base fare 50 + distance * 2.0
3.	Create a main() method to:
o	Instantiate each type
o	Call calculateFare() for a sample distance
o	Print the output with transport type
üì• Sample Input:
int distance = 20;

üì§ Expected Output:
Bus Fare for 20 km: ‚Çπ10.0
Train Fare for 20 km: ‚Çπ16.0
Taxi Fare for 20 km: ‚Çπ90.0
