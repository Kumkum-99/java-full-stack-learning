* Employee Analytics Using Java Streams
🔍 Scenario:
You are working in an HR tech startup. You’ve received a CSV file with thousands of employee records.
Your task is to process this file and extract insights using Java Streams API.

🗂️ Input File: employees.csv
Each line in the CSV contains:
id,name,department,salary,location,age
📄 Example:
101,John Smith,Engineering,95000,New York,29
102,Alice Johnson,Marketing,75000,San Francisco,32
103,Bob Davis,Engineering,110000,Austin,35
104,Emma Watson,HR,60000,New York,26

✅ Tasks to Implement Using Java Streams
1.	Load the CSV file and convert it into a list of Employee objects.
2.	Find the average salary across all departments.
3.	List all employees in the 'Engineering' department, sorted by salary descending.
4.	Group employees by location and count how many are in each city.
5.	Find the highest paid employee in the company.
6.	Calculate the average age of employees per department.
7.	Partition employees into two groups: younger than 30 and 30 or older.
8.	Find departments with employees having salary > 100000.
9.	Create a Map: Department -> List of Names, sorted alphabetically.
