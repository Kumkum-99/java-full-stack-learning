Assignments for this week:

1] Student Marks Analyzer

You are given the marks of a student in 5 subjects. Write a program to calculate and print the average,
 highest, and lowest marks.

Input:
int[] marks = {78, 85, 62, 90, 71};

Expected Output:
Average Marks: 77.2
Highest Marks: 90
Lowest Marks: 62

2] Reverse an Array (Useful in UI/UX Scrolling)

Reverse the order of items in an array, such as reversing the order of images or recent activity logs.

Input:
int[] activityLog = {101, 102, 103, 104};

Expected Output:
Reversed Log: 104 103 102 101

3] Website Visitor Tracker
Track the number of visitors on a website for 7 days. Find on which days the traffic was below average.

Input:
int[] visitors = {300, 500, 400, 450, 600, 200, 350};

Expected Output:
Average Visitors: 400.0
Days with below average traffic: Day 1, Day 6, Day 7



4] Score Improvement Tracker
Given a student's test scores over time, determine how many times their score increased compared to the previous test.

Input:
int[] scores = {70, 75, 73, 80, 85, 82};

Expected Output:
Number of Improvements: 3

Explanation: Score improved from 70→75, 73→80, 80→85.

5] Check if Array is Sorted in Ascending Order
Write a method that checks whether the array is sorted in ascending order.

Input:
int[] arr = {3, 5, 8, 9, 12};

Expected Output:
Is Sorted: true

6] Move All Zeros to End
Move all 0s in an array to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

Input:
int[] arr = {0, 1, 0, 3, 12};

// start=0, end= arr.length-1 arr[start]==0

Expected Output:
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

7] Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array

Remove duplicates from a sorted array. Return the new length and array (ignore extra space after).

Input:
int[] arr = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4};

Expected Output:
Unique Length: 4
Modified Array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
